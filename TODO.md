# TODO

- [ ] **Bulb Group Functionality**: Implement and test the ability to control multiple bulbs simultaneously using group IDs.
    - [ ] **Spatial Layout Awareness**: Add capabilities for the SDK to understand and leverage the physical positioning of bulbs for coordinated effects.
- [ ] **AI-Optimized Command Output**: Refine CLI output (e.g., more compact JSON, reduced verbosity) to conserve tokens when driven by AI agents.
- [x] **Live Visualization Sources**:
    - [x] Audio reaction mode (e.g., syncing lights to music via `audio_stream.py`).
    - [x] Other live data-driven visualization sources (e.g., Art-Net DMX via `artnet_stream.py`).
